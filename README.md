# ISL-Python-Unofficial

This is my presonal attempt to replicate the second edition the book ['*An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications is R*'](https://www.statlearning.com) in Python.

The code is incomplete and contains only the following chapters:
- Chapter 3: Linear Regression.
- Chapter 4: Classification.
- Chapter 5: Resampling Methods.
- Chapter 6: Linear Model Selection and Regularization.
- Chapter 7: Moving Beyond Linearity.
- Chapter 8: Tree-Based Methods.

The code is written in Jupyter notebooks. In particular, it is based on [Quarto's Jupyter notebook extension](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html), so some code cells contain Quarto commands. However, the code should work fine in a regular Jupyter notebook. Learn more about Quarto [here](https://quarto.org).

I am not affiliated with the authors of the book or the R package. I am just a student who is trying to learn more about statistics and machine learning. I have only started to learn Python, so there may be a lot of ways to improve the code. I am open to suggestions and pull requests.

Also, this code is greatly inspired by the [ISLR-python](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python) repository. Thanks @JWarmenhoven for the great work!
 
P.S. This code will probably become obsolite once the authors release the Python version of the book this summer (the specific date is not yet known).
